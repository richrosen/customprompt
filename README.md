# customprompt
Customize your shell prompt in living color with current working directory, system identification and git branch support

## What this script does

By including this script at login time, your shell prompt will be modified in the following ways:

1. A line going across the entire width of the screen will appear...
2. above a line displaying the `username@computername` by default...
3. followed by a colon and the path of the current working directory...
4. and a `$` on a new line

The script causes a break to a new line before displaying the `$` so that there is enough room on the line to enter a command.

## Directions

1. Copy the `bin/custompromptrc.sh` file into your home directory, renaming it to `.custompromptrc` 
1. Source the file in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file

   + ```source ~/.custompromptrc```
1. Open a new shell window or re-login to the shell. You should see sdflkjsdlfkdsjlfksdjflkdsjfls
